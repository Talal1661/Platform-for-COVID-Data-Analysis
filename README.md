## Dashboard for interactive visualization to explore Covid Data
Developed an interactive visualization tool using Dash Plotly that effectively provides the Covid data. Different types of interactive charts are displayed where a user can filter the data according to different combinations of attributes and explore their relationships. Moreover, a prediction of total cases and deaths is also made on time series for the next three months.
